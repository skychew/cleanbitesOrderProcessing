Oddle.me is an online FnB platform that is designed for simple menu ecommerce. They could not accomodate that we wanted to sell food on specific dates. Therefore I wrote a google script to extract confirmed email with order details and sorted them out on google spreadsheet. They are sorted by date that is attached at the end of the menu item name as well as in remarks.
